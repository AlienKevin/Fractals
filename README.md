# Fractals and Graphics

Sierpinski triangles and flood fill written in C++ as an assignment for CS106B at Stanford Summer Session 2019.

## Sierpinski triangles

The **Sierpinski triangle** is a [fractal](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fractal) and [attractive fixed set](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Attractive_fixed_set) with the overall shape of an [equilateral triangle](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Equilateral_triangle), subdivided [recursively](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Recursion) into smaller equilateral triangles. ([Wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle))

## Flood fill

**Flood fill,** also called **seed fill,** is an [algorithm](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Algorithm) that determines the area [connected](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Glossary_of_graph_theory#Connectivity) to a given node in a multi-dimensional [array](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Array_data_structure). It is used in the "bucket" fill tool of [paint programs](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Paint_program) to fill connected, similarly-colored areas with a different color, and in games such as [Go](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Go_(game)) and [Minesweeper](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Minesweeper_(video_game)) for determining which pieces are cleared. ([Wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Flood_fill))
